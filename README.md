# First React Projetct!



This was my first react project, and with it I remade my very first website. It's quite simple but it shows how much I learned and progressed over these view years!




## Changes


I've added css for dark mode users on all platforms (I've only tested on IOS and Windows, but I'm confident it will work).


Also it is now completely mobile friendly, and should work on any platform and look pretty on any screen!
